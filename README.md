# RTS-Game
 [In development]The basis of an RTS Game in Unity, with unit testing. 
 
Control various units, each of them having particular abilities
 
This project aim at first to implement some core mechanics of an RTS game : spawn units, move around, use special abilities.. Regarding the development I gave myself two objectives:
- Having a data driven architecture by using Scriptable Objects. This would allow to create large quantity of contents in a second steps, without intercating too much with the source code
- Being completly testable without runing the game by using unit tests, substitute and mock. Again, this would allow to safely add extra contents in a second development phase.
